# Hello-World
Where we are head we dont need roads;)
The beginning of a new journey starts here 
An attempt to learn and improve acceleration\image processing and rendering\ P2P
Project device tablet_k1
The device is a little outdated technology wise and by all accounts was a great product. I have not seen what i believe the potential of the technology is capable of. Having a great persistant nature and unwillingness to settle for " good enough" i have taken up this project to gain the basic understand, the knowledge, and the experience to do more than simply accept anything less than determining, through proven methods and trial and error ( as may be the nature of such a project ) to determine which methods will prove to be able to "unleash" the device to a new level of performance.
 The starting levels have been tested and documented for reference to compare results with as work is performed to see the improvments or loss of performance if a methods is found to be less effective. 
 My background is electronic diagnostics related. Programming is a new aspect of interaction with the hardware. Having the knowledge and understand of computer components and how they work on an electrical level is significantly different from programming the instructions and a big learning curve. I enjoy expanding my knowledge and sharing knowledge. The network of open-source allows for such growth. I am very thankful for all the wonderful resources that i have found. With out the hard work that has gone into the technology none of this would be possible.
